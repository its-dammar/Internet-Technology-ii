### Assignment Questions for Unit 5: PHP File Handling, Sessions, and Error Handling  

1. **File Reading and Writing:**  
   Write a PHP program to read text from a file and add new data entered by the user through a form. Show an error message if the file cannot be opened.  

2. **Using Include and Require:**  
   Create a simple webpage with separate files for the header, footer, and main content. Use `include` and `require` to join these files. Handle the case where a file is missing.  

3. **Sessions and Cookies:**  
   Make a login system where the username is saved in a session. Also, use a cookie to save the user's theme choice (like light or dark mode) so it remembers their preference when they visit again.  

4. **Role-Based Access:**  
   Build a simple system where only admins can access some pages and regular users are blocked. Use sessions to store and check the user's role.  

5. **File Permissions:**  
   Write a PHP script to check if a file has the right permissions and change them if needed. Explain why secure file permissions are important.  

6. **Handling Errors:**  
   Create a program to upload files. Use `try-catch` to handle errors like wrong file types or failed uploads. Save error details in a log file.  

These simplified questions focus on clarity and practical understanding for easier implementation.
